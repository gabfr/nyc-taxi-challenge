# NYC Taxi Challenge

This project aims to answer a few specific questions regarding the NYC Taxi Trips Dataset with the objective
of analysing the taxi's performances and improve its through logistic reorganization and service improvement.

The key questions we'll answer here are:

 - Daily average distance for trips with 2 passengers max;
 - The largest vendors (in terms of trips revenue) of the semester;
 - The monthly price frequency (also known as histogram) of the trips paid in cash;
 - Daily tips revenue amount in the last 3 months of 2012;
 - Monthly average trip duration on weekends;
 - And lastly, but not leastly, a visualization map per month of pickups locations and also monthly 
visualization maps of dropoffs locations too.
